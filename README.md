## Assignment 2 Version 1

**Learning Journal: Building a Website with PHP, CSS, and JavaScript on XAMPP localhost WordPress**

### Learning Activities & Resources

In initiating this endeavor, I took the initiative to set up essential tools, creating accounts on Trello, Slack, and GitHub. Thankfully, I discovered insightful guides and videos online that eased the process, allowing me to navigate the initial setup with relative ease.

In the subsequent phase, my focus shifted to establishing connections between Trello, GitHub, and Slack. This step resembled constructing a bridge, seamlessly linking these diverse platforms. The integration enabled our team to monitor tasks effortlessly and receive real-time updates on code changes within our team chat on Slack, creating a more streamlined and efficient collaborative environment.

The website, as it stands now, is not the final product but a dynamic template that will undergo significant transformations as we progress. It serves as a canvas upon which we can experiment with design elements, functionalities, and user interactions. The purpose of this prototype is to test ideas, identify potential improvements, and validate the overall concept before committing to the final development.

Progressing further, I began populating our Trello board with foundational information, outlining project goals and tasks. Simultaneously, I contributed code to our GitHub repository. This phase felt akin to laying the groundwork for a construction project, and I eagerly anticipate witnessing the project evolve further.

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/IsaiahWang/AcademixConnect)

In this collaborative digital landscape, each platform serves a unique purpose, creating a synergy that propels our project forward.

### Estimated Hours

Up to this point, I've invested around 5 hours in the setup and integration process. Despite encountering a slight learning curve initially, I'm steadily gaining proficiency. Looking ahead, I anticipate dedicating another 5-10 hours this week to finalize the organization of our project, ensuring it's fully prepared for launch.

### Content Insight

Our Trello board acts as a visual roadmap for our project, delineating sections for tasks, ideas, and feedback. It serves as an invaluable tool to grasp the entirety of the project at a glance, fostering alignment within the team.

The GitHub repository acts as a digital library, securely housing our code files and facilitating seamless collaboration. It serves as a safeguard for our project's critical assets.

Meanwhile, Slack operates as our virtual team room—a central hub for communication, updates, and queries. Its functionality proves crucial in maintaining connectivity, particularly in a remote working setup.

In leveraging these platforms strategically, we've created an ecosystem that not only supports our project's development but also enhances our team's efficiency and communication.

### Analytics using SMART rules

- **Specific:** Our Trello board boasts specific tasks with explicit deadlines and designated team members.
- **Measurable:** Progress tracking involves monitoring completed tasks and the frequency of code updates.
- **Achievable:** Our goals are ambitious yet realistic, broken down into manageable steps.
- **Relevant:** The selected tools align directly with our project's needs, ensuring efficiency in goal attainment.
- **Time-bound:** Set deadlines for each project phase ensure adherence to the timeline and meeting established targets.

By adhering to SMART rules, our project management approach becomes not just a strategy but a framework that propels us toward success.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This experience is proving instrumental in acquiring valuable skills related to project management, collaboration, and version control—essential competencies in the ever-evolving tech landscape. The prospect of adding these skills to my professional toolkit is genuinely exciting.

Collaborating on this project with my team is contributing significantly to my communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills—attributes transferrable to any workplace scenario.

Adaptability is a key takeaway, with the understanding that technological landscapes continually shift. Learning to navigate new tools and workflows is not just an asset but a necessity, and this experience is honing my adaptability and versatility as a learner.

As I navigate this project, I'm not just building a website; I'm constructing a foundation for lifelong skills and professional growth.

### Why XAMPP as Local Host

One may wonder why I chose XAMPP as the local host for this project. XAMPP, an acronym for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P), provides a comprehensive and user-friendly environment for web development. The decision to use XAMPP is rooted in its ease of setup, which consolidates essential components like Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP interpreter. This all-in-one package significantly simplifies the local hosting process, allowing for seamless development and testing of PHP-based web applications. XAMPP serves as a reliable and efficient local server solution, facilitating a realistic development environment before deploying the website to a live server.

### Why PHP, CSS, and JavaScript

The strategic choice of PHP, CSS, and JavaScript is based on their individual strengths:

- **PHP:** Renowned for server-side scripting, seamlessly integrating with databases like MySQL.
- **CSS:** Indispensable for enhancing visual appeal, enabling precise styling and formatting.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamism to web pages, crucial for an engaging user experience.
