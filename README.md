**Assignment 2 Version 1**

**Learning Journal: Building a Website with PHP, CSS, and JavaScript on XAMPP localhost WordPress**

**Learning Activities & Resources**

In initiating this endeavor, I took the initiative to set up essential tools, creating accounts on Trello, Slack, and GitHub. Thankfully, I discovered insightful guides and videos online that eased the process, allowing me to navigate the initial setup with relative ease.

In the subsequent phase, my focus shifted to establishing connections between Trello, GitHub, and Slack. This step resembled constructing a bridge, seamlessly linking these diverse platforms. The integration enabled our team to monitor tasks effortlessly and receive real-time updates on code changes within our team chat on Slack, creating a more streamlined and efficient collaborative environment.

Progressing further, I began populating our Trello board with foundational information, outlining project goals and tasks. Simultaneously, I contributed code to our GitHub repository. This phase felt akin to laying the groundwork for a construction project, and I eagerly anticipate witnessing the project evolve further.

**Estimated Hours**

Up to this point, I've invested around 5 hours in the setup and integration process. Despite encountering a slight learning curve initially, I'm steadily gaining proficiency. Looking ahead, I anticipate dedicating another 5-10 hours this week to finalize the organization of our project, ensuring it's fully prepared for launch.

**Content Insight**

Our Trello board functions as a visual roadmap for our project, delineating sections for tasks, ideas, and feedback. It serves as an invaluable tool to grasp the entirety of the project at a glance, fostering alignment within the team.

The GitHub repository acts as a digital library, securely housing our code files and facilitating seamless collaboration. It serves as a safeguard for our project's critical assets.

Meanwhile, Slack operates as our virtual team room—a central hub for communication, updates, and queries. Its functionality proves crucial in maintaining connectivity, particularly in a remote working setup.

**Analytics using SMART rules**

Specific: Our Trello board boasts specific tasks with explicit deadlines and designated team members.
Measurable: Progress tracking involves monitoring completed tasks and the frequency of code updates.
Achievable: Our goals are ambitious yet realistic, broken down into manageable steps.
Relevant: The selected tools align directly with our project's needs, ensuring efficiency in goal attainment.
Time-bound: Set deadlines for each project phase ensure adherence to the timeline and meeting established targets.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

This experience is proving instrumental in acquiring valuable skills related to project management, collaboration, and version control—essential competencies in the ever-evolving tech landscape. The prospect of adding these skills to my professional toolkit is genuinely exciting.

Collaborating on this project with my team is contributing significantly to my communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills—attributes transferrable to any workplace scenario.

Adaptability is a key takeaway, with the understanding that technological landscapes continually shift. Learning to navigate new tools and workflows is not just an asset but a necessity, and this experience is honing my adaptability and versatility as a learner.

**Why XAMPP as Local Host:**

One may wonder why I chose XAMPP as the local host for this project. XAMPP, an acronym for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P), provides a comprehensive and user-friendly environment for web development. The decision to use XAMPP is rooted in its ease of setup, which consolidates essential components like Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP interpreter. This all-in-one package significantly simplifies the local hosting process, allowing for seamless development and testing of PHP-based web applications. XAMPP serves as a reliable and efficient local server solution, facilitating a realistic development environment before deploying the website to a live server.


**Why PHP, CSS, and JavaScript:**


The choice of PHP, CSS, and JavaScript as the primary technologies for this project is deliberate and strategic.

**PHP:**

PHP is a server-side scripting language renowned for its versatility in web development. Its ability to seamlessly integrate with databases, such as MySQL, aligns perfectly with the project's requirements. PHP empowers the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages, making it an ideal choice for server-side processing.

**CSS:**

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is indispensable for enhancing the visual appeal of web pages. It allows for the precise styling and formatting of HTML elements, ensuring a polished and user-friendly interface. CSS enables the creation of responsive and aesthetically pleasing designs, contributing to a positive user experience.

**JavaScript:**

JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamism to web pages. Its capabilities in creating responsive user interfaces and handling asynchronous events make it an essential component for enhancing the overall user experience. In this project, JavaScript will be utilized to introduce interactive elements, ensuring a more engaging and dynamic website.
